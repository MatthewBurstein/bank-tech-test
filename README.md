#### Possible extensions
Had I more time, it would be interesting to extend the project, for example by:
- Adding functionality for the bank to edit transactions, eg changing dates or amounts
- Adding a front end for the user interface
- Persisting the data in a database and creating user login functionality to handle different customers
